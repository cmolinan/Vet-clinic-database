# Vet Clinic Database 

> In this project, I used a PostgreSQL relational database to create the initial data structure for a vet clinic. 
> A table to store animals' information has been created, inserting some data into it. 
> After that, more tables has been created, with foreign keys to join tables, and indexes for improve querys performance.
> Also, I created a new database based on a diagram
> The repository contents the files generated while working on the project.
## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. 
**Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
